                                <p> Artsmark is the creative quality standard for schools, accredited by Arts Council England.
                                    Artsmark provides a clear framework for teachers to plan, develop and evaluate arts, culture and creativity across the curriculum. 
                                    We have worked hard to provide as many opportunities for our children to work within the Arts: Music, Dance, Drama and Art. 
                                    Our children have been on many visits to theatres, shows and galleries and have opportunities to work with artists who visit our school.
                                     Our curriculum continually develops to enhance children’s learning through all areas of the Arts.
